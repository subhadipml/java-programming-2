Can we apply Binary search algorithm to a sorted Linked list?
---------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, Binary search is possible on the linked list if the list is 
ordered and you know the count of elements in list. But While sorting the list, 
you can access a single element at a time through a pointer to that node 
i.e. either a previous node or next node.

What are the applications of Graph DS?
---------------------------------------

i)In Computer science graphs are used to represent the flow of computation.
ii)Google maps uses graphs for building transportation systems, where intersection of 
two(or more) roads are considered to be a vertex and the road connecting two vertices 
is considered to be an edge, thus their navigation system is based on the algorithm to 
calculate the shortest path between two vertices.
iii)In Facebook, users are considered to be the vertices and if they are friends then 
there is an edge running between them. Facebook’s Friend suggestion algorithm uses graph 
theory. Facebook is an example of undirected graph.
iv)In World Wide Web, web pages are considered to be the vertices. There is an edge 
from a page u to other page v if there is a link of page v on page u. This is an example 
of Directed graph. It was the basic idea behind Google Page Ranking Algorithm.

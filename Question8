What are the different types of traversal techniques in a tree?
-----------------------------------------------------------------

i)Inorder Traversal
In this traversal method, the left subtree is visited first, then the root 
and later the right sub-tree. We should always remember that every node may represent a subtree itself.
If a binary tree is traversed in-order, the output will produce sorted key 
values in an ascending order.
Until all nodes are traversed −
Step 1 − Recursively traverse left subtree.
Step 2 − Visit root node.
Step 3 − Recursively traverse right subtree.

ii)Preorder Traversal
In this traversal method, the root node is visited first, then the left subtree 
and finally the right subtree.
Until all nodes are traversed −
Step 1 − Visit root node.
Step 2 − Recursively traverse left subtree.
Step 3 − Recursively traverse right subtree.

iii)Postorder Traversal
In this traversal method, the root node is visited last, hence the name. First we traverse the 
left subtree, then the right subtree and finally the root node.
Until all nodes are traversed −
Step 1 − Recursively traverse left subtree.
Step 2 − Recursively traverse right subtree.
Step 3 − Visit root node.

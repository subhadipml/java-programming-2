The principal benefit of a linked list over a conventional array is that 
the list elements can be easily inserted or removed without reallocation or 
reorganization of the entire structure because the data items need not be stored 
contiguously in memory or on disk, while restructuring an array at run-time 
is a much more expensive operation

Linked list provides the following two advantages over arrays
i) Dynamic size
ii) Ease of insertion/deletion

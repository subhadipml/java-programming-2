Which data structure is ideal to perform recursion operation and why?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Stack. Because of its LIFO (Last In First Out) property it remembers its ‘caller’ 
so knows whom to return when the function has to return. Recursion makes use of system 
stack for storing the return addresses of the function calls.

Every recursive function has its equivalent iterative (non-recursive) function. 
Even when such equivalent iterative procedures are written, explicit stack is to be used.

What is the difference between an Array and Stack?
-----------------------------------------------------

Stacks
i)Stacks are based on the LIFO principle, i.e., the element inserted at the last, 
is the first element to come out of the list.	
ii)Insertion and deletion in stacks takes place only from one end of the list called the top.	
iii)Stack has a dynamic size.	
iv)Stack can contain elements of different data type.	
v)We can do only linear search	

Array
i)In the array the elements belong to indexes, i.e., if you want to get into the fourth 
element you have to write the variable name with its index or location within the square bracket eg. arr[4]
ii)Insertion and deletion in array can be done at any index in the array.
iii)Array has a fixed size.
iv)Array contains elements of same data type.
v)We can do both linear and Binary search

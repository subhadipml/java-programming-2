When can you tell that a Memory Leak will occur?
--------------------------------------------------

In computer science, a memory leak is a type of resource leak that occurs when 
a computer program incorrectly manages memory allocations in a way that memory 
which is no longer needed is not released. A memory leak may also happen when an 
object is stored in memory but cannot be accessed by the running code.
